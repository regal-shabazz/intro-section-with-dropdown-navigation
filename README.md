Intro section with dropdown navigation

![Design preview for the Intro section with dropdown navigation coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.



Feel free to contribute.
